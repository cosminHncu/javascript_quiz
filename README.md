<h1>Javascript Quiz</h1>
<br>
The Javascript Quiz project is a fun and educational tool that uses React to create a dynamic and interactive quiz experience. This project was built as a first project using React, and is designed to test users' knowledge of Javascript concepts and syntax.

The quiz project features a series of multiple choice questions, each with two to four possible answers. At the end of the quiz, the app displays the user's final score.

Overall, the Javascript quiz project is a fun and engaging way to test and improve your knowledge of Javascript. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn more about the language, or a seasoned developer looking for a fun challenge, this quiz has something for everyone.
